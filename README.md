##Usage
The website consists of three pages. The first page, porsche.html, features a navbar that guides you to the other two pages, vehicles.html and experience.html. porsche.html also includes a button in the middle of the page that redirects you to the vehicles.html page. The vehicles.html page includes a call to action and a button that guides you to the bottom of the page. The bottom of the page holds dynamically generated cards of various Porsche vehicles. The vehicles info is stored in a JSON file, and the functionality of the cards was created within a file called porsche.js. Each card includes a button that redirects you to view the vehicle on the Porsche official website or buy the vehicle on the Porsche official website. The last page, experience.html, is a simple page with a call to action and a button that redirects you to the Porsche official website for their "Porsche Experience" program.
