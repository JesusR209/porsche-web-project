Porsche-Web-Project

I. Installation
To get started with the Porsche-Web-Project, you will need to have Git LFS (Large File Storage) installed on your machine. Git LFS is used to store large binary files, such as images and videos, that may be used in your project. You can download Git LFS from the Git LFS website.

Once you have Git LFS installed, you can clone the Porsche-Web-Project repository from GitHub using the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/JesusR209/porsche-web-project.git
Note that this project uses Git LFS to store the vehicle images used in the project. After cloning the repository, you will need to unpack the image files using Git LFS. To do this, navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following command:

Copy code
git lfs pull
This will download and unpack the large image files that are stored in the repository. Once this process is complete, you can open the porsche.html file in your web browser to view the website.

Note that this website is designed for desktop use only and has not been optimized for mobile devices.

II. Usage
The website consists of three pages. The first page, porsche.html, features a navbar that guides you to the other two pages, vehicles.html and experience.html. porsche.html also includes a button in the middle of the page that redirects you to the vehicles.html page. The vehicles.html page includes a call to action and a button that guides you to the bottom of the page. The bottom of the page holds dynamically generated cards of various Porsche vehicles. The vehicles info is stored in a JSON file, and the functionality of the cards was created within a file called porsche.js. Each card includes a button that redirects you to view the vehicle on the Porsche official website or buy the vehicle on the Porsche official website. The last page, experience.html, is a simple page with a call to action and a button that redirects you to the Porsche official website for their "Porsche Experience" program.
